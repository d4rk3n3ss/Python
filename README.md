# Python

This script was a solution that I found to facilitate the search for a file in a specific directory.

In Windows, this functionality already exists, but I saw an opportunity to further deepen my knowledge.


The script has a problem where the file to be fetched needs to have the exact name, as the script validates against a list in python
